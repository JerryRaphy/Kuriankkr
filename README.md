# Hey there üëã Welcome!

## A little bit about me....

<p>
  <img width="250" align='right' src="https://github.com/Kuriankkr/Kuriankkr/blob/main/Images/Data_Science.jpg">
</p>


I am an Industrial Engineering graduate at **<img src= "https://github.com/Kuriankkr/Kuriankkr/blob/main/Images/Ohio_st.png" width="20">**  with a background in **operations research and data analytics**. I work as a part time **student research assistant** applying predicitive modelling techniques in material science domain.

I like to identify challenging problems that I face around me and try coming up with possible solutions with the skill sets that I have. More often that not! I end up realizing I have to read more, learn more, code more when tackling these problems and this is why I love the field I work in! When I am not coding, I try my luck on my üéª and and some new dishes üçï 

Below are some of my personal projects and capstone projects (as a part of online courses thaT I have undertaken) that I would like the world to see!

# Covid-19 Dashboards and Visualization

These dashboards and visualization notebooks originated because of the pandemic around me and I thought this was little way of contributing to the pandemic apart from socially distancing and following the CDC guidelines üôè. Click [here](https://github.com/Kuriankkr/Covid19_Data_Analysis) to dive into them

## BlueBook for Bulldozers
One of the first projects that I worked on and it helped me learn a lot! It involved sourcing the data from Kaggle as a part of a competition and predicting the sales price of Bulldozers that we being sold during an auction.

## Predict Future Sales
I like to use data science specifically to predict the sales of items(an area of my interest), be it the tractors project ‚òùÔ∏è or in this project where the goal was to predict the total amount of products sold in every shop for a supermarket chain. 

I had borrowed techniques from other fellow Kagglers and learnt a lot on the kind of strategies and technique that one should look into during feature engineering. This notebook focuses heavily on feature engineering that captures the trend of previous sales. Click [here](https://github.com/Kuriankkr/Predict-Future-Sales) to dive into the notebooks
