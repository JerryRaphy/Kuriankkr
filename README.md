# Hey there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

## A little bit about me....

<p>
  <img width="250" align='right' src="https://github.com/Kuriankkr/Kuriankkr/blob/main/Images/Data_Science.jpg">
</p>

I am an Industrial Engineering graduate at **<img src= "https://github.com/Kuriankkr/Kuriankkr/blob/main/Images/Ohio_st.png" width="20">**  with a background in **operations research and data analytics**. I work as a part time **student research assistant** applying predicitive modelling techniques in material science domain. I like to identify challenging problems that I face around me and try coming up with possible solutions with the skill sets that I have. More often that not! I end up realizing I have to read more, learn more, code more when tackling these problems and this is why I love the field I work in! When I am not coding, I try my luck on my violin and and some new dishes!


## [**BlueBook for Bulldozers**](https://github.com/Kuriankkr/Bluebook-for-Bulldozers)
One of the first projects that I worked on and it helped me learn a lot! It involved sourcing the data from Kaggle as a part of a competition and predicting the sales price of Bulldozers that we being sold during an auction. Click on the title or [here](https://github.com/Kuriankkr/Bluebook-for-Bulldozers> to dive into the notebooks)
